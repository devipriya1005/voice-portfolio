    <p>Hi! I'm Devi Priya,I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Information Technology. I'm highly interested in full-stack web development,cloud platforms like AWS, and emerging AI tools. I enjoy solving problems and building user-friendly, intelligent applications. My goal is to become a software developer who builds impactful products.I recently completed a cloud computing project titled Trivia Game Leaderboard, which uses AWS services like EC2, S3, and RDS to host, store, and manage game data. This project helped me gain practical experience with cloud-based web application deployment, database integration,and leaderboard tracking features.I'm a passionate web developer currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and voice interfaces.I'm building this Voice-Controlled Portfolio as my second web project.</p>
